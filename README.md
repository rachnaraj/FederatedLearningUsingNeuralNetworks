**Provisioning Privacy in Environmental Crowd-sensing Using Federated Learning**

The Internet of Things (IoT) technology integrates a level of intelligence into objects, allowing them to perceive their surroundings. These objects then transmit the collected data to a central server, which analyses the information and determines the appropriate course of action to be executed in response.

Mobile Crowd-sensing (MCS) is an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) that utilises smart devices carried by humans to collectively perceive the surrounding environment. The data produced by these widely prevalent devices is transmitted to a distant server, where it undergoes processing and analysis, primarily utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies.

Historically, the execution of these artificial intelligence (AI) processes has taken place at distant servers, where the accumulated data is utilised to train machine learning (ML) models. Preserving user privacy poses a formidable challenge in the given scenario, as the data acquired has the potential to encompass sensitive or confidential user information, such as location data. An further concern is to the utilisation of bandwidth for transmitting the collected data from these devices to the server.

Federated Learning (FL) is a compelling approach that shows potential in effectively implementing intelligent privacy-preserving Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The process is achieved by training models on IoT devices using locally gathered data and subsequently consolidating these models on the server. Initially, the preservation of user privacy is accomplished by ensuring that no data is shared with the server. Furthermore, the amount of bandwidth generated is greatly reduced as only the necessary model changes are communicated between the server and the devices. The initial segment of this research investigates the soundness of employing FL in the context of missing data inference in environmental Monte Carlo simulations. Through simulations utilising an established dataset, it has been seen that Federated Learning (FL) demonstrates comparable performance to conventional Machine Learning (ML) methods, specifically Neural Networks (NN). Notably, FL achieves this while upholding the crucial aspect of user privacy. The latter phase of the research entails the development of a privacy-conscious framework for the exchange of model updates in federated learning, with the primary objective of safeguarding the privacy of those updates.
